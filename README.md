# ChatWithBot

Hello! My name is Cold, I am second year at Rochester Insitute of Rochester which is I am majoring in Appiled Computer in Studies.  I'm still pretty new to Python and programming in general, so I’m exploring things by building this simple chatbot project. The idea is to create a friendly program called RoboPal that chats with the user by asking a few fun questions.

This Python file is all about:

Practicing user input() and print()

Using if/else statements to make choices based on user responses

Working with a while loop to keep the conversation going

Learning how to structure a function using def

Experimenting and changing things as I learn more. 

Right now, RoboPal asks the user if they like pizza, what their favorite color is, and whether they’d rather travel to the moon or dive under the sea. It keeps talking until the user types "bye".

I'll be adding more features, fixing things, and tweaking the flow as I keep learning. Thanks for checking it out!
